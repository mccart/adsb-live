ADSB-Live is an Rxjs-based library for connecting to ADSBExchange's live TCP connection. It
includes a sample GraphQL (Apollo) server to support subscribing to the data. Note that the
sample server is primarily for development purposes, and probably can't handle heavy user loads.

# Installation

Simply clone this repo, and run 

```bash
npm install
```

# Usage

You can run the GraphQL server with

```bash
npm start
```
